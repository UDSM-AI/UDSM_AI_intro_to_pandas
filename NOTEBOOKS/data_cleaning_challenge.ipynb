    "### Dataset Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Patient ID: Unique identifier for each patient.\n",
    "- Admission Date: Date when the patient was admitted.\n",
    "- Discharge Date: Date when the patient was discharged.\n",
    "- Primary Diagnosis: Primary diagnosis for the patient's condition.\n",
    "- Comorbidities: Pre-existing comorbidities of the patient.\n",
    "- Medication History: History of medications taken by the patient.\n",
    "- Length of Stay: Duration of the patient's stay in the hospital.\n",
    "- Readmission Status: Indicates whether the patient was readmitted.\n",
    "- Age: Age of the patient.\n",
    "- Gender: Gender of the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning Tasks:\n",
    "1. Handle missing values in the dataset appropriately.\n",
    "2. Remove any inconsistent or incorrect data entries.\n",
    "3. Standardize the format of the Primary Diagnosis column (e.g., capitalize the first letter, remove leading/trailing spaces).\n",
    "4. Remove any duplicates in the dataset.\n",
    "5. Convert empty values in the Medication History column to NaN.\n",
    "6. Ensure that all date-related columns (Admission Date, Discharge Date) are in the correct date format.\n",
    "7. Validate and correct any inconsistent or invalid values in the Age column.\n",
    "8. Hint: lenghth of stay can never be a negative value\n"
